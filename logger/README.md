# Centralized Logging with Alloy, Loki, and Grafana

This logging stack uses **Alloy** to collect all logs from the Docker engine and forward them to **Loki** for storage and querying. **Grafana** provides dashboards and log exploration.

## How It Works

- **Alloy** acts as the log collector, reading all logs from the Docker engine.
- Alloy forwards these logs to **Loki**, a log aggregation system.
- **Grafana** connects to Loki, allowing you to visualize and search logs from all your containers in one place.

This setup avoids the need to configure logging drivers in each containerâ€”Alloy captures everything at the Docker engine level.

## Services

- **Alloy**: Collects all Docker logs and forwards to Loki
- **Loki**: Stores and indexes logs
- **Grafana**: Dashboards and log search

## .env Configuration

The `.env` file is used to securely configure credentials and environment variables for the logging stack. For a stable and secure setup, you should:

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in all required values.
- Set strong, unique passwords for Grafana and Loki.
- Configure domain names to match your deployment (e.g., for HTTPS certificates).
- Review and adjust any other environment variables for your infrastructure (such as email for Let's Encrypt notifications).

Keeping your `.env` file up to date and secure ensures reliable authentication, encrypted connections, and smooth operation of all logging services.
